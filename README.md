- Python3
- django=1.8.4

### Test Isolation and Global State
Different test shouldn't affect one another

### Working State to Working State(aka Testing Goat vs Refactoring Cat)
Don't Fix everything at once... we'll end up like refactoring cat

### YANGI
You aren't gonna need it!. Avoid the temptation to write code that you think might be useful.
